# NAME

JavaScript::Const::Exporter - Convert exported Perl constants to JavaScript

# VERSION

version v0.1.5

# SYNOPSIS

Support a project has a module that defines constants for export:

```perl
package MyApp::Const;

use Exporter qw/ import /;

our @EXPORT_OK = qw/ A B /;

use constant A => 123;
use constant B => "Hello";
```

Then you can export these constants to JavaScript for use with a
web-application's front-end:

```perl
use JavaScript::Const::Exporter;

my $exporter = JavaScript::Const::Exporter->new(
    module    => 'MyApp::Const',
    constants => [qw/ A B /],
);

my $js = $exporter->process
```

This will return a string with the JavaScript code:

```
const A = 123;
const B = "Hello";
```

# DESCRIPTION

This module allows you to extract a list of exported constants from a
Perl module and generate JavaScript that can be included in a web
application, thus allowing you to share constants between Perl and
JavaScript.

# ATTRIBUTES

## use\_var

When true, these will be defined as "var" variables instead of "const"
values.

## module

This is the (required) name of the Perl module to include.

## constants

This is an array reference of symbols or export tags in the
["module"](#module)'s namespace to export.

If it is omitted (not recommened), then it will look at the modules
`@EXPORT_OK` list an export all modules.

Any subroutine can be included, however if the subroutine is not not a
coderef constant, e.g. created by [constant](https://metacpan.org/pod/constant), then it will emit a
warning.

You must include sigils of constants. However, the exported JavaScript
will omit them, e.g. `$NAME` will export JavaScript that specifies a
constant called `NAME`.

## has\_constants

True if there are ["constants"](#constants).

## include

This is an array reference of paths to add to your `@INC`, when the
["module"](#module) is not in the default path.

## has\_include

True if there are included paths.

## pretty

When true, pretty-print any arrays or objects.

## stash

This is a [Package::Stash](https://metacpan.org/pod/Package::Stash) for the namespace. This is intended for
internal use.

## tags

This is the content of the module's `%EXPORT_TAGS`. This is intended
for internal use.

## json

This is the JSON encoder. This is intended for internal use.

# METHODS

## process

This method attempts to retrieve the symbols from the module and
generate the JavaScript.

On success, it will return a string containing the JavaScript.

# KNOWN ISSUES

When using with [Const::Fast::Exporter](https://metacpan.org/pod/Const::Fast::Exporter)-based modules, you must
explicitly list all of the constants to be exported, as that doesn't
provide an `@EXPORT_OK` variable that can be queried.
